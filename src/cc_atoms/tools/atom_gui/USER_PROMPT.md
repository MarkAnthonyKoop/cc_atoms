Create a GUI to monitor atom progress.    Do it by starting in the cwd (or a directory specified on the command line).

The GUI should have a main window that tracks the current session (see if you can use atom_session_analyzer to get details and updates.   feel free to add features if needed)

    the main window will show the current session (which could be in a subproj.   track the subdirs and timestamps to get the latest, and scroll through what is being updated.

included another window that shows all sessions (expandable tree view) and double clicking tracks the latest in each session
