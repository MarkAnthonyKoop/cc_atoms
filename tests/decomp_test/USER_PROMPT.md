# Create a simple calculator module

Create a Python module called `calculator.py` with:

1. Functions for add, subtract, multiply, divide
2. A function that takes a string like "2 + 3" and evaluates it
3. Proper error handling for division by zero
4. Unit tests in `tests/test_calculator.py`

The tests should pass when run with pytest.
