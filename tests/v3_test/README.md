# Simple Test Project

## Overview
A simple test file demonstrating basic arithmetic functions, created to verify the atom system is working correctly.

## Status
COMPLETE

## Progress
- [x] Created simple_test.py with basic arithmetic functions
- [x] Verified all tests pass

## Current State
- `simple_test.py`: Contains add, subtract, multiply, and divide functions with self-test capability

## Files
- `USER_PROMPT.md`: Task specification
- `README.md`: This documentation
- `simple_test.py`: The test implementation

## Usage
```bash
python3 simple_test.py
```

## Decisions
- Used basic arithmetic functions as they're simple, universally understandable, and easy to verify
- Included a self-testing main block for easy verification
