# Step 3 of 5: Write unit tests for core functionality

## Main Task (for context)
# Create a simple greeting module

Create a Python module called `greeter.py` with:
1. A function `greet(name)` that returns "Hello, {name}!"
2. A function `farewell(name)` that returns "Goodbye, {name}!"
3. Tests in `tests/test_greeter.py`

3. Create/modify files as needed to complete this step
4. Be thorough but stay focused on this step only
